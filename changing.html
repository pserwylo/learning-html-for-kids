        <h1>Change the code</h1>

        <p>You can't change the code on this website, this is my website :)</p>

        <p>But you can save a copy of it to your computer and make changes there... that is YOUR website!</p>

        <h2>Step 1: Save a page to your computer</h2>

        <p>Press "Ctrl + S" to save this page (or any other page) to your computer.</p>

        <p>Open the file you downloaded - notice how it opens in a web browser, because it is a HTML file, and HTML files usually mean websites, so they open in a web browser.</p>

        <p>Soon, when you are making changes to your file, you will regularly want to open it in a web browser to see what it looks like after you make changes.</p>

        <p>Open the program called "Notepad" on your computer.</p>

        <p>From Notepad, you can click "File" then "Open"</p>

        <p>At first, Notepad wont be able to see your HTML file, because Notepad is normally for editing text files.</p>

        <p>This is why when you try to open a file in Notepad, it says "Files of type: Text Document".</p>

        <p>If you change the "Files of type" to "All files", then you should be able to open (and change!) the HTML file you downloaded.</p>

        <p>Make some changes, save the file, and open the file in a browser again - can you see your changes now?</p>
