        <h1>Hi Kids!</h1>

        <p>I'm Pete, and I make websites for a job.</p>

        <p>This is a little website I made so you can see how to make website too!</p>

        <p>It might be a little bit hard to teach during Coronavirus because I can't sit next to you...</p>

        <p>... but one of the best ways to learn is to explore.</p>

        <p>This website is for you to explore.</p>
