        <h1>A little bit boring</h1>

        <p>It starts off a little bit boring.</p>

        <p>But we will make it more interesting.</p>

        <p>The best thing about boring websites is they are easier to understand and learn from.</p>

        <h2>How can you learn from this?</h2>

        <p>Websites are made from a language called "HTML".</p>

        <p>You can always read the HTML that makes a website...</p>

        <p>Try pressing "Ctrl + U" on your keyboard now to see the HTML for this page (and any other page too)!</p>

        <p>(You can do that from any page on the website)</p>

        <p>Can you see the HTML code?</p>

        <a href="index.html">Previous page</a>

        <a href="simple-content.html">Next page</a>
